To study the representational power of a GNN, we analyze when a GNN maps two nodes to the same location in the embedding space.
Intuitively, a maximally powerful GNN maps two nodes to the same location only if they have identical subtree structures with identical features on the corresponding nodes.
Since subtree structures are defined recursively via node neighborhoods (Figure 1), we can reduce our analysis to the question whether a GNN maps two neighborhoods (i.e., two multisets) to the same embedding or representation.
A maximally powerful GNN would never map two different neighborhoods, i.e., multisets of feature vectors, to the same representation.
This means its aggregation scheme must be injective.
Thus, we abstract a GNNâ€™s aggregation scheme as a class of functions over multisets that their neural networks can represent, and analyze whether they are able to represent injective multiset functions.
